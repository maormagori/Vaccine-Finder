# Vaccine-Finder
During August of 2021 3rd vaccince shots were made avalible to the publi of Israel. Me, as a serving solider in the IDF had to rely on their appointment system to find a appointment near me. During the first days the system was fludded and appointments were taken the moment they were posted. To combat that I've written this script that fetches the appointments, filters them, and prints them to the console every 500 ms. Plus, A beeping sound is played every time a relevent appointment is found.
